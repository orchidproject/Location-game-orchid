\subsubsection{Player Interfaces}
\noindent First responders are equipped with a `mobile responder tool' providing sensing and awareness capabilities in three tabs (geiger cou\-nter, map, messaging and tasks; see Figure \ref{fig:ui}). The first tab shows a reading of radioactivity, player health level (based on exposure), and a GPS-enabled map to locate fellow responders, the targets to be rescued and the drop off zones for the targets. The second tab provides a broadcast messaging interface to communicate with fellow first responders and the HQ. The third tab shows the team and task allocation dynamically provided by the agent $PA$ that can be accepted or rejected. Notifications are used to alert both to new messages and task allocations.

$H$ has at her disposal an `HQ dashboard' that provides an over\-view of the game area, including real-time information of the players' locations (see Figure \ref{fig:ui}). The dashboard provides a broadcast messaging widget, and a player status widget to monitor the responders' exposure and health levels. $H$ can further monitor the current team and task allocations to individual responders by $PA$ (by clicking on a button). Crucially, only $H$ and $PA$ have a view of the radioactive cloud, graphically depicted as a heatmap (`Hotter' (red) zones correspond to higher levels of radiation).

%\subsection{System Architecture}
\noindent AtomicOrchid is based on the open-sourced geo-fencing game MapAttack. The location-based game is underpinned by a client-server architecture that relies on real-time data streaming between client and server for frequent events (e.g., location updates and radiation exposure). In this way, first responders are kept informed in near real-time. Finally,  to build the mobile app, we adapted the existing MapAttack Android app.

%The platform is built using the geoloqi platform, Sinatra for Ruby, and state-of-the-art web technologies such as socket.io, node.js and the Google Maps API. 

\subsubsection{Integrating the Planning Agent}
\noindent The planning agent $PA$ takes the game status (i.e., positions of players, known status of the cloud, and messages received from players) as input and produces a plan for each responder  for the current state.  The AtomicOrchid server requests a plan from the agent by transmitting the game status. Polling (and thus re-planning) is triggered by two types of game events:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Completion of task}. On successful rescue of a target, a new plan (i.e., allocation of tasks to each responder) is requested from the agent.
\item \textit{Explicit reject}. On rejection of a task by any of the first responders, a new plan is requested. The rejected allocation is used to constrain the set of solutions returned. For example, if two responders (a medic and a soldier) were allocated a task and the solider rejected it, the planning agent would search for an  allocation with the constraint that this soldier should not be allocated this task.
\end{itemize} 

%\subsection{Interacting with planning agent}
%There can interact directly with field players through a task tab (Figure xx) and agent plans are also visible to HQ's dashboard interface.
Once a plan is received from $PA$, the AtomicOrchid game engine splits the plan for a given team into individual task allocations for each player and sends them to their mobile responder app. The app presents the task allocation in the task tab, detailing: i) the responder to team up with, ii) the allocated target (using target id), and iii) approximate direction of the target (e.g., north, east).  %Once a player accepts a task, an acknowledgement is sent to their teammate, while rejecting a task triggers a new assignment from $PA$. 

%Furthermore, $H$ is provided with a visualisation of task allocations for each player on demand (by button press), to help monitor the task allocation computed by the agent.
