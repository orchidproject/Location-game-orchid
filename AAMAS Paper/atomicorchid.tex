\section{The A\lowercase{tomic}O\lowercase{rchid} Platform}\label{sec:atomicorchid}
\noindent In this section we describe the AtomicOrchid platform used to embed the planning agent in order to trial mixed-initiative coordination.
We adopt a serious mixed-reality games approach to counteract the limitations of computational simulations. For example, Simonovic highlights that simulations may rely on unrealistic geographical topography, and most importantly, may not account for ``human psychosocial characteristics and individual movement, and (...) learning ability'' \cite{simonovic:2009}. The impact of emotional and physical responses likely in a disaster, such as stress, fear, exertion or panic remains understudied in approaches that rely purely on computational simulation \cite{drury:etal:2009}. In contrast, our approach creates a realistic setting in which participants experience physical exertion and stress through bodily activity and time pressure, mirroring aspects of a real disaster setting \cite{paho:2001}; thus providing greater confidence in the efficacy of behavioural observations regarding team coordination supported by a planning agent.

In more detail, Atomic Orchid is a location-based mobile game based on the fictitious scenario described in Section \ref{sec:scenario}. Field responders are assigned a specific role (e.g. `medic', `transporter', `soldier', `ambulance'). In their mission to rescue all the targets from the disaster space, the field responders are supported by (at least) one person in a centrally located HQ room, and the planning agent that sends the next task (as described in the previous section) to the team of field responders. In what follows, we present the player interfaces used, the interactions with the planning agent, and the modelling of the radiation cloud in the game.
