% This is "aamas2014.tex", a revised version of aamas2013.tex
% This file should be compiled with "aamas2014.cls"
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'aamas2014.cls'
% LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to AAMAS 2014  conference. This file is based on
% the sig-alternate.tex example file.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file of ACM will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
% than the original style ACM style.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls ) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with AAMAS data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) through 3) above.
%
% Using 'aamas2014.cls' you don't have control
% from within the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the IFAAMAS Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% These information will be overwritten by fixed AAMAS 2014  information
% in the style files - it is NOT as you are used with ACM style files.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%

% This is the document class for full camera ready papers and extended abstracts repsectively

\title{AtomicOrchid: Human-Agent Collectives to the Rescue\vspace{-6mm}}
% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%

\numberofauthors{3}

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

%\begin{abstract}
%The allocation of emergency responders to rescue tasks is a key application area for agent-based coordination algorithms. However, to date, none of the proposed approaches take into account the inherent uncertainty in disaster scenarios and, crucially, none have been field-trialled in order to understand how humans perform when instructed by an agent. Hence, in this demo, we propose a mixed-reality game called AtomicOrchid, with an agent that works alongside a human commander to guide human players to complete rescue tasks.
