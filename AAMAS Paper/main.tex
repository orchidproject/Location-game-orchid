% This is "aamas2014.tex", a revised version of aamas2013.tex
% This file should be compiled with "aamas2014.cls"
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'aamas2014.cls'
% LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to AAMAS 2014  conference. This file is based on
% the sig-alternate.tex example file.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file of ACM will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
% than the original style ACM style.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls ) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with AAMAS data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) through 3) above.
%
% Using 'aamas2014.cls' you don't have control
% from within the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the IFAAMAS Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% These information will be overwritten by fixed AAMAS 2014  information
% in the style files - it is NOT as you are used with ACM style files.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{Mixed-Initiative Coordination for Disaster Response in the Real-World}

% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
The problem of allocating emergency responders to rescue tasks is a key application area for agent-based coordination algorithms. However, to date, none of the proposed approaches take into account the uncertainty predominant in disaster scenarios and, crucially, none have been deployed in the real-world in order to understand how humans perform when instructed by an agent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, using Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes to coordinate emergency responders. More importantly, we deploy this algorithm in a mixed-reality game to help an agent guide human players to complete rescue tasks. In our field trials, our algorithm is shown to improve human performance and our results allow us to elucidate some of the key challenges faced when  deploying of mixed-initiative team formation algorithms. \end{abstract}
